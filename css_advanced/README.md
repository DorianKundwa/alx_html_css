# CSS, advanced

This project focuses on building the visual design of the homepage from the HTML, advanced structure using modern CSS only.

- Keep the given HTML semantics and accessibility in mind
- Implement layout, typography, colors and components to match the design

## Design resources

- Figma page: https://www.figma.com/design/kdohXOV0iKKzQGX9KB2Uhh/Homepage--Copy-?node-id=0-1&t=V7lKHtzKHa93I3pg-1
- Images/assets: Provided in this repository under `css_advanced/images/` (add as needed)
- Fonts: Source Sans Pro, Spin Cycle OT

## Getting started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Edit styles in `styles.css` (or scoped styles) to match the Figma
3. Keep layout responsive; follow breakpoints from the design

## Project structure

```
css_advanced/
  index.html
  styles.css
  images/
```

## Notes

- Some Figma measurements are fractional; round as needed
- Replace any placeholder assets with the final exported images
- Do not change the core layout semantics from the HTML, advanced base
